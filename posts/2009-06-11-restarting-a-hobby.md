<p>In my youth (aka when I was 30) I ran a marathon, and had not run since until today. </p>

<p>My entire life, running is something I would do for a while and really enjoy, only to walk (ha!) away from it for a while. Life would get it the way (I would move, a new job would keep me too busy, {insert any other excuse here}). But then I would remember that I enjoyed it, and lace up again. </p>

<p>This latest break of five years since the marathon has been the longest. I have been considering running again for the last few weeks, but have had reservations: the narrow road I live on isn&#x2019;t safe for running, I&#x2019;m too busy with work and a new baby, {insert any other excuse here}. So when a friend called me up and asked me if I wanted to run the <a href="http://www.obxmarathon.org/">Outer Banks Marathon</a> in November, I decided to go for a trial run this morning.</p>

<p>But first, to prepare! I need shoes, and shorts, and a fancy shirt; running socks, a gps, a smaller ipod, a runners log book.  A couple of days ago I read Chad Fowler&#x2019;s <a href="http://chadfowler.com/2009/6/9/the-unexpected-consequences-of-consumerism">article</a> on this exact situation: where we plan a new hobby, and instead of just doing it, we buy all the tools we need as a way to feel like we are making progress, instead of just doing it. I know I&#x2019;ve done that &#x2013; in my recent quest to learn to play guitar, I&#x2019;ve accumulated: a guitar, a gig bag, a stand, two tuners, a capo, and a stack of books, but I don&#x2019;t yet really know how to play. After reading Chad&#x2019;s article, I decided to be more mindful of that tendency. I resisted the urge to buy anything for running, at least until I&#x2019;m actually doing it on a regular schedule (and then all I&#x2019;ll really need is a new pair of shoes). Last night, I gave in to the urge and started writing a <a href="http://sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> based running log application. I told myself I was doing it to learn Sinatra better, and to learn <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>, but did I really do it to feel like a runner? </p>

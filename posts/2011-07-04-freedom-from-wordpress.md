Greetings! I just ported this blog from [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) to
[awestruct](http://awestruct.org/), the best static site generator out there 
(translation: the one with which I'm most familiar). What better way to celebrate
independence on this July 4th than freeing my blog from unnecessary and insecure
dynamic generation?

Maybe this will spur me to post more. Then again, maybe it won't. I am planning
to blog the conversion process so you can follow along at home.

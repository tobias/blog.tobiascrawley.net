<p>I love to read. In college, I had no social life for the first two years because I lived within walking distance of a 9-floor library. I always had a book in my pocket or in my hand, and read constantly. Sometimes I would read while walking to class. Then I got busy with college life, harder classes that required more coding and less reading. So reading became a hobby rather than an obsession.</p>

<p>After college, I took a job working on a large app written in C at a company 3000 miles from home. I had time to read again! Not only was there no homework, there was no social life, since it was a new town. I also had a bit of time to read at work while the app was building and tests were running. </p>

<p>After the C project, I moved onto a team doing Java. Now, in addition to the building/testing time for reading, I was forced to read! Everything I wanted to do required reading 2-3 javadoc pages, with a &#x2018;choose your own adventure&#x2019; element. I would have an object of class <code>A@, and what I really needed was an object of class @B</code>. Starting at the doc for each end, I would try different paths to get to the other end, often backtracking at dead ends. </p>

<p>Then I moved into web development, and started with good ole&#x2019; <span class="caps">PHP.</span> I lost a lot of the api adventure from Java and lost the build/test reading breaks (testing?). But I gained more time for reading! &#x2018;How?&#x2019; you ask? Job security! The code I wrote lacked cohesion, followed few standards, and was unmaintainable by anyone else. I became an essential part of the organization, and could come and go as I pleased. So I read in the morning, came in late, read at lunch, and left early to read back at home.</p>

<p>And then it all went to shit. I started programming in ruby. </p>

<p>No more api reading &#x2013; I would guess at method names, try them out in <code>irb</code>, and be right most if the time. No more compile breaks. Testing? Yes, but with autotest, it was <em>quick</em>. I could barely find my place on the page before the tests were done. No more job security &#x2013; I was writing code the &#x2018;ruby way&#x2019;, or the &#x2018;rails way&#x2019;, and any competent ruby/rails programmer could pick it up. So no more leaving early/arriving late. And coding was fun again! All those other languages felt too much like work. So no more reading at home either &#x2013; just sitting in front of my laptop, hacking away on crap. Hell, I even started doing the opposite of reading; I started writing about ruby.</p>

<p>F you ruby.</p>
